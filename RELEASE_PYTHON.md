# HOW TO RELEASE A PYTHON GAME

- Make sure everything is up to date:
    - `git pull`
- Choose a version as $major.$minor.$patch (e.g. 1.32.2)
- Run `./release.py $version`. This script is now gone, but can be found
  [here](https://github.com/battlecode/battlehack20/blob/master/release.py).
- Go on Discord and wait for things to catch on fire
